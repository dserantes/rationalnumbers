This simple college project coded in Java helps us doing calculations using rational numbers and storing the results in a given file.

In mathematics, a rational number is a number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction pq of two integers, a numerator p and a non-zero denominator q.

For example, âˆ’37 is a rational number, as is every integer (e.g. 5 = 51).
